Please place code where it says code here.  Run the code and make sure it matches the output.  I would save a copy of this original iPython notebook in case you delete the cell that has the output.  Please pay attention to where you actually move the csv file to or set your working directory accordingly.

I will answer questions about the format of the lab but I will not answer any coding questions or Jupyter environment questions.  You will have 75 minutes to complete this assignment.
