# Course: BUAN 6340 – Programming for Data Science ( Python )
Spring 2018

This course covers many aspects of programming for data science and analytics, including syntax, handling data, data visualization, and implementation of statistical analysis models. The course will be taught using Python language

Specifics include:
• Python Programming Fundamentals
• Graph / Network Analytics (NetworkX)
• Statistical Libraries (NumPy, SciPy)
• Data Wrangling, Data Munging, Data Cleansing (Pandas)
• Data Visualization (matplotlib)
• Web Page Screen Scraping / Parsing HTML (Beautiful Soup)
• Interfacing Python with Relational Databases using SQL (SQLAlchemy)
• Machine Learning
o from libraries (Scikit-Learn)
o from source code (since Scikit-Learn is open source, we will study the actual
source code for several common machine learning algorithms) o Scale Out (brief look at Spark MLlib)
• Natural Language Processing (NLTK)
• Deep Learning / Neural Networks (TensorFlow)
• Programming Labs (in class)
o Most weeks we will have a programming lab in class based on the previous
week’s content
• Programming Assignments (outside of class)
o These will include topics such as proper usage of numpy, Pandas, Python’s data
visualization libraries, sci-kit learn, et al in order to conduct both elementary and advanced data analysis.
