Problem Statement

There are two datasets.  Both of these are classic datasets.  The first one is an auto MPG dataset to predict the mpg based on the other features.  

The second dataset is a telelcom dataset where you have to predict whether the customer is going to churn (leave the telecom company) or not

Logistic: This is attached

Please use Pandas and any Data Viz Libraries at your disposal. I would like to see a full data science project to an extent.  Obviously we are on a short timeframe here but graphs/charts showing the distribution of the data and how the features interact with each other.  I would expect a fully mature model.  Part of the grading will be based on your methodology and your results.
