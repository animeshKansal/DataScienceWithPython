# Final Remark:

Accurary table: ( On Test Set )

1. Multinomial NB: 87.92%
2. Cross Validated NB: 88.93%
3. Random Forest: 90.37%
4. Cross Validated RF: 89.94 %
5. Adaboost Classifier: 85.95%

So the winner is Random Forest Classifier in this particular case .
But Execution time for NB was much lesser than RF .
and RF may overfit very easily.

# Things to Learn:

1.Gaussian NB: It should be used for features in decimal form. GNB assumes features to follow a normal distribution.

2.MultiNomial NB: It should be used for the features with discrete values like word count 1,2,3...

3.Bernoulli NB: It should be used for features with binary or boolean values like True/False or 0/1.
